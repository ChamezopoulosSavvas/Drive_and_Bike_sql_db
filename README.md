# Drive_and_Bike_sql_db

This is a project developed for the ECCE Auth Course - Database Systems

The Developers Team (Chamezopoulos Savvas, Mytilis Konstantinos, Ntokos Konstantinos) designed and built a small database simulating a small automotive dealership whose main products are cars and motorcycles, along with parts and repair services for these products.
The DB was built on a local PC on the mariaDB server (v. 5.5.57) through MySQL (v. 5.7.9.)

The follwing schematic represents the main stucture of the database:

Other than the administrator, a few other users were designed to access the database (Salesman, Engineer, Accountant, Client)

Some indicatory queries and views are also implemented for you to explore
